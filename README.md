Yes, themes can have children. And they are an important aspect of building your WordPress website on the right foundations.

You need a WordPress child theme to allow for customizations that aren’t overwritten when your WordPress theme is updated.

## What is a WordPress child theme?

According to [this tutorial on Divi Banks blog](https://www.divibanks.com/complete-divi-child-theme-guide/) – “a child theme in WordPress is a sub-theme that inherits all the functionality, features, and style of its parent theme”.

## Do I need a Divi child theme?

In my opinion. YES!

I recently had a new client who came to me with a site that hadn’t been updated in several years. 39 plugins, 4 themes, and the WordPress core were out of date, on top, he couldn’t update his PHP version because everything could break.

We discovered she had custom code in his theme that was overwritten when we updated.  

**Huge mistake!!**

But, here is the thing.

He needed a Divi child theme! 

A theme contains 1000s of files so digging through to find the customizations was not a fun project but now his website is up to date and can be updated without breaking.

## Reasons Why You Should Use a Child Theme

- Keep your customizations whenever the parent theme is updated to a new version. 

- Avoid update errors

- Allows for room for error

- Provides an opportunity for growth
